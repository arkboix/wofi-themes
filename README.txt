To install,

Download the .css file and launch wofi like this:

wofi -s /path/to/downloaded/theme.css --show drun

What is Wofi anyway?

It's an application launcher, meant to replicate the rofi app launcher but on wayland.

What are Wofi themes?

Wofi looks ok by default, but css files can be used to change the style of wofi and make it look beautiful, get started with my 20+ themes.
